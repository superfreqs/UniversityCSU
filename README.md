Understanding utilization of existing space resources across the University of North Carolina Wilmingtons (UNCW) campus has  applications in long-term, short-term and real-time emergency needs. This information can be used to support plans for upgrades  and expansions of the physical plant, as well as assist in the scheduling of classes under normal circumstances and in the event of needing to reassign class room space. Historical data can be used to understand trends in space usage, provided it can be collected and organized uniformly.  Additionally,fundamental characteristics that define the potential use of the elements must be included to understand trends in the use of specialized spaces with in the physical plant. With such information in hand, an interactive, administration facing, web-based dashboard for assessing space utilization at UNCW has been developed for the visualization of roomusage across the university.
